# Fractal plotting for a paper about fractals and economics

To run this analysis, you'll need Numpy and Matplotlib.

Run `calc_fractal.py` to generate the data, then run `fig1.py`.

Then change `calc_fractal.py` to be order 5 and 6 polynomials and
repeat for figures 2 and 3.

Finally, run `fig4.py` to get the bar plot for figure 4.

Replace `secret_key.dat` with your own secret key to be able to run
on your cloud account.
